# Jeremy Goldsmith's Leader Readme
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my leader readme. It took me some time and introspection to write this document. I hope you find it a useful tool to better understand me and how I think and operate as a leader and manager.

# Purpose of this document
It takes time to get to know a leader and learn about their values and leadership style. This document is intended to be a helpful guide to getting to know me, my values, expectations and quirks. Whether you report directly to me, are a member of the organization I oversee, or interact with me in some way, my hope is that this document will shorten the time it takes for us to work successfully together.

# My role
I'm a senior engineering leader, which means I oversee multiple teams, groups and workstreams, and manage other leaders and managers. At the end of the day, my job is to ensure that we successfully deliver high-quality software that drives value for our customers and helps our business grow. 

## Delivery
A key concept is "delivery" - we could have the most mature software organization with the most amazing architectures and codebases, but if we aren't frequently delivering value then it doesn't really amount to much. Also, notice I say "delivering value" instead of "delivering software" - because the software we write and systems we build have to deliver value to customers in order to affect the business results we want to achieve.

## Things I pay attention to

There are a few things I pay close attention to:
* how frequently we deliver value
* software quality
* the health of our systems
* the health of the teams I oversee
* our ability to operate efficiently
* the business and customer impact of the work we do

Here are some indicators I look for to know if those things are on track:
* Frequently deliver value:
  * Are we shipping frequently?
  * Are our teams hitting their sprint or release goals?
  * Are we accomplishing our strategic objectives and advancing on our product roadmap?
* Software quality and system health:
  * Are customer-impacting issues being reported in the software we produce?
  * Are other teams or systems negatively impacted by bugs in our software?
  * Are system uptime and reliability metrics healthy, or do we have frequent outages?
  * Do we extract learnings from our inevitable mistakes, and share them internally?
* Team health:
  * Are members of our teams engaged, productive and happy?
  * Do people have professional development plans and are making progress on their goals?
  * Are people getting recognized for their contributions?
  * Do teams celebrate their accomplishments?
  * Are people learning from mistakes and from one another?
* Efficient operation:
  * Are we staying within our budgets for people, systems and organization?
* Business and customer impact:
  * Do we have healthy business growth, and can we tie that to our product features and/or software?
  * What feedback are we getting from customers? sales? support?

There are several areas that I try to focus on - people, teams, projects, technology, product strategy, and organizational coordination - whew, that's a lot! I have to jump around a lot, but I end up investing a lot of my time coaching people and teams, with the goal of helping them become "high performing teams" so they can deliver a lot of value and be mostly autonomous. If I have high performing teams, that means I can multiply my impact. And having a big impact is what really motivates me.

## The Triad
At most modern companies, especially Software-as-a-Service companies, software engineering can't be successful in isolation. Great digital products and user experiences are built by having a close partnership of Product Management, Product Design and Engineering, aka "The Product Development Triad". I'm a strong believer in this partnership, and work hard to align myself with Product and Design leaders, and organize product development teams to follow suit. I like to identify our function in the company as Product Development (or ProdDev) instead of separate functions of Engineering and Product. We're better together and aligned.

# What do I value most?
Here are some of my core values as an engineering leader:

## Results matter
A favorite phrase of mine is "We're not just building software, we're building a business." We're here to drive certain business results, not just to build software in a vacuum. Understand the business drivers and make sure you're incorporating them into your decisions and actions.

## Bias for action
I'd rather make progress and move forward than endlessly talk about it or try to design the perfect solution to a problem. Move forward, even if you end up making a mistake. You'll likely learn something useful that you would never have known.

## Simple solutions
I believe that building simple solutions are far better than complex ones. Some people enjoy the intellectual challenge of solving complex problems or feel that they would be a better engineer if they can understand and build complex systems. But building unnecessary complexity into software has lots of negative consequences, like over-engineered systems, performance issues, and software that is hard to debug or change. Take a simple approach and use simple tools and languages, and simplify legacy software when you can. Some of the best, most effective engineers build simple things. 

## Incrementalism
Build and deliver software in small chunks, in increments. Don't plan for big, long-running projects that only deliver at the end. Break big problems down into small pieces, define milestones along the way (if appropriate) and most importantly, learn and adjust as you go. This gives you the ability to test your assumptions and hypotheses and incorporate a dose of reality into your execution. The truth is, we're probably wrong about something, we just don't know where yet. Embrace "Think Big, Build Small, Learn Fast".

## Be Humble
You're probably wrong about something, you just don't know exactly where. Don't assume you have all the answers. Learn from others, admit mistakes and focus on learning and continual improvement instead of trying to be the smartest person in the room. I try to hire low-ego engineers for this exact reason. The ones who care a lot about being smart and right usually make the worst mistakes and don't drive good results. Care more about delivering value than being right.

## Healthy Conflict
Don't be afraid of conflict, debates, and arguments. Embrace them. Keep them respectful and professional, but otherwise don't hold back. Avoid toxic conflict, where people get offended or take things personally. We should be trying to find the best solutions, and the best ideas should win on the merits. To me, high performing teams embrace healthy conflict. They debate ideas passionately, use data and evidence to make their case, and know when to say, "Okay, I think your idea is the best one, let's go with it." They don't take things personally or get offended, they can keep relationships intact. That requires building strong relationships and establishing a certain amount of trust on a team. 

## Be Kind
There's no space in my organization for brilliant assholes. I expect people to be kind and respectful to one another, even when they disagree. If, after being given multiple opportunities and feedback, you demonstrate that you're unable to live up to that expectation, then you should work elsewhere. I will make sure that's the case if needed. I believe that psychological safety is essential to creating the environment where people can thrive and high performing teams emerge. I will do everything I can to create that environment in teams I oversee.

## Growth
I'm a big believer in personal and professional growth. I don't think it's possible to stay stagnant in terms of your skills and abilities. Either you're moving forward or you're moving backward. Always be working toward achieving something, with a good mix of personal, interpersonal and professional goals. Write them down. Track your progress. Have a plan. 

## Have a beginner's mind
Sometimes we get too wrapped up in legacy thinking or how we've always done things, and we don't see the optimal way to solve a problem. Try to be open-minded and see a situation from the eyes of someone discovering it for the first time. Don't be afraid to jettison outdated approaches, even if they used to work well in the past. Have a beginner's mind.

 ## Have fun
 Life is too short to be unhappy at work. Be serious about your work, but lighthearted about your day. I love to crack jokes, be silly and laugh with the people I work with. Donâ€™t take yourself too seriously. If youâ€™re not having a good time at work, youâ€™re not doing it right! ðŸ˜„
 
# My Management Style
As a people manager, everything I do is focused on one goal: *helping you be as effective as possible in your role.* 

In order to help you be as effective as possible, I try to do the following things:
* Clarify Expectations
  * Make sure you know what's expected of you in your role
  * If you're unsure, please ask!
* Deliver Timely Feedback
  * Both positive and constructive feedback about how youâ€™re doing compared to expectations
  * Positive feedback is important - so you know if there's something you're doing that's working well or need to do more of something
  * I'll be honest and upfront with constructive feedback about things that aren't working well or could be improved. 
  * I try my best to give timely feedback, so you can adjust quickly
  * If I'm doing my job properly, you shouldnâ€™t be surprised in a performance review - it should largely be things we've already talked about. 
* Give Context
  * Business context to help you connect the dots between the work you're doing and the business goals
  * I can provide insight into whatâ€™s coming up ahead - things you may not see or know about
* Be a Sounding Board
  * If youâ€™re struggling with something, you can use me as a sounding board. 
  * I'm a good listener, and will likely ask probing questions.
  * Sometimes, people find the answer by the time they finish explaining something
  * Can be technical, professional, personal (note: I'm not a licensed therapist!)
* Provide Career Coaching
  * At some point, I will ask you to write a professional development plan
  * You own your career development, and can decide how much time/effort to invest
  * I can help you clarify and make your plan more actionable
* Remove Barriers
  * If you're running into organizational, process or (some) technical barriers, I might be able to help
* Get Out of Your Way
  * I donâ€™t pretend to be a better engineer than you (although I know a few things!)
  * I trust you to make good decisions, own your work (unless I have reason not to)
  * I may ask questions or challenge at times
  * I try very hard not to be a micro-manager, but I do expect good results

## 1:1s
I consider 1:1s very important, and try not to miss or cancel them. You can always reach out for an impromtu 1:1 if you need to talk.

### For Direct Reports
If you report directly to me, I prefer to have a 1:1 weekly or every other week. I like having a place for 1:1 topics that we can both populate ahead of time (if we think of them) in a shared doc or Slack canvas. 

Here are some example topic areas we can discuss.

From me:
* What's happening in the business
* Any feedback for you
* What's on my mind
* Coaching / professional development guidance

From you:
* What's going well / what are you excited about
* What's challenging / what are you struggling with
* How is work going - updates on the work you're doing
* Deep dive into a problem you are solving or recently solved
* What questions do you have
* What progress have you made on your career development

### Skip-Level 1:1s
If you are in my organization, but don't report directly to me, I like to have skip-level 1:1s. This is a chance for me to learn about what's going on at the ground level of the organization, get feedback about your manager, team or project, provide some guidance or coaching if I can, answer your questions and hopefully give additional context about the business direction and strategy. Ideally I can help you connect the dots between the work you're doing day-to-day and the longer-term company strategy. I also enjoy getting to know people. I try to schedule skip-level 1:1s with as many people as I can, and also encourage you to reach out and schedule a skip-level 1:1 with me. 


# The Best Place We've Ever Worked&trade;
One of my ultimate goals is to create the best work environment of our careers. Seriously. This isn't an empty slogan, I really believe that's something we can do if we work at it. To me, that means this is the place we worked harder, learned more, delivered more value, laughed more, challenged ourselves more, built the best relationships and teams, than anywhere else we've worked. It's an ambitious goal, but very worthwhile, in my opinion. I strive to do whatever I can to create that environment - for myself, for you, and for our team. Let's talk about how we can make this the best place we've ever worked.  

# How Am I Doing?
I also need feedback in order to learn what I'm doing well and where I need to improve. Honest feedback is really important in a leadership role, and actually really hard to get, especially from the people I oversee. So I'm giving you permission to give me feedback. Let me know what I'm doing well and areas where I can do better. I appreciate it, so thanks in advance!
